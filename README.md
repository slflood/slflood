- 👋 Hi, I’m Stacie Flood, aquatic ecologist @SFWMD
- 👀 I’m interested in prediction of phytoplankton dynamics and modeling biogeochemical factors associated with bloom persistence, termination and ecological interactions influencing potential toxicity
- 🌎 I am using Google Earth Engine and Remote Sensing tools
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Julia
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using spatial statistics and ML to describe coastal ecosystem ecological dynamics
- 📫 email away to stacie.flood@gmail.com
